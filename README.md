# Welcome to RSHub!
Remote Sensing Hub (RSHub) is a shared cloud computing platform for the remote sensing community to compute microwave scattering properties based on microwave electromagnetic scattering mechanisms.

## Getting Started
RSHub utilizing **tokens** to run, query, and download results. Register your account today to get a token!!

### Steps to run your code
1. Go to [RShub wesite](https://rshub.zju.edu.cn/Login) to register your account and get an access token.
2. Navigate to your scenario and check parameter lists
3. Explore scenario demos for a quick start
      
#### Explore scenario demos
- [x] **[Vegetation demo 1](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/RShub_demo/blob/main/Run_Total_RTE_Veg_from_server.ipynb): Layered Vegetation Brightness Temperature at Multi-frequencies** 🌵🌲🌳🎍🎋🌾

    > This demo compares the brightness temperature at 1.41 and 6.925 GHz of nonuniformly distributed vegetation covered land surfaces based on the radiative transfer theory.

- [x] **Vegetation demo 2: Uniform vs. Layered Vegetation Brightness Temperature** 🌵🌲🌳🎍🎋🌾

    > This demo compares the brightness temperature from uniformly and nonuniformly distributed vegetation covered land surfaces at 1.41 GHz based on the radiative transfer theory.

- [x] **Snow demo 1: Brightness temperature and backscatter of a three-layer snow scenario**

    > This demo estimates multilayer brightness temperature and/or backscatter of snow using DMRT-QMS model.

- [x] **Snow demo 2: Brightness temperature and backscatter of a three-layer Snow scenario**

    > This demo estimates multilayer brightness temperature and/or backscatter of snow using DMRT-BIC model.

- [x] **Snow demo 3: Comparison of backscatter estimates from two snow models**

    > This demo compares the multilayer backscatter of snow estimated from DMRT-BIC model and DMRT-QMS model.

- [ ] **Multi-layer Soil Model (upcoming)**
